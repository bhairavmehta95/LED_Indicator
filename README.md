# 3M LEDIndicator

A Python Web App that runs alongside 3M LEDPi (Also on this account) to control LEDs through the 3M SEMS IoT and Web/Serial communication.

The app also hooks up to the Microsoft Graph API and uses Bluetooth proximity sensing (see 3M LEDPi) to change lights semi-autonomously.

## Website Information

The web application can be found at https://enigmatic-wildwood-87269.herokuapp.com.
The application was configured through the Heroku Deployment services, so to reproduce at another url, simply:

Clone this repository (Repo A) \n
Create a Python/Django WebApp on Heroku \n
Clone that repository into another place (Repo B)
Replace the files of Repo A with the files of Repo B
Deploy to heroku using the command line (Heroku Toolbelt).
